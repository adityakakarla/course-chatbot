This is a chatbot that utilizes data from UC San Diego's data science course descriptions.

I utilized Node.js, Langchain, and Supabase to create this chatbot.

I used Langchain to chain together prompts and fetch data from Supabase (which stored the vector emebeddings of the data science course descriptions).

Using Node.js, I created an interactive environments, where readers can interact with the chatbot from the command line.

This project taught me about embeddings, vector databases, and handling command line inputs. I'm excited to continue exploring LLM applications!
